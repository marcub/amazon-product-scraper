# Amazon Product Scraper

Amazon Product Scraper is a full-stack application that allows users to search for products in real-time across different regional Amazon websites. The frontend is built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, using Vite as a build tool, while the backend is developed in Node.js with Express to handle the web scraping logic.

- **Real-time Scraping**: The backend fetches and parses data directly from Amazon at the time of the request, ensuring up-to-date information.
- **Functional Pagination**: Scrapes and implements the search results' pagination, allowing users to navigate through pages.
- **Responsive UI**: A clean and minimalist user interface that adapts to different screen sizes.

- **Frontend**:
  - HTML5
  - CSS3
  - JavaScript (Vanilla)
  - Vite.js (Development environment and build tool)

- **Backend**:
  - Node.js
  - Express.js
  - Axios (For HTTP requests)
  - JSDOM (For server-side DOM manipulation)
  - Nodemon (For development)

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
